# Temperature-Monitoring-with-Control-System
Temperature Monitoring with Control System is a C++ program integrated with Proteus that enables users to monitor temperature levels in real-time and control the temperature using a feedback loop. The program reads data from temperature sensors, processes it, and sends control signals to a cooling or heating system to maintain a desired temperature. The integration with Proteus allows users to simulate the program's functionality and test it virtually before implementing it in a real-world setting.
